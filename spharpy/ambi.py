        Parameters
        ----------
        data : ndarray, double
            Raw data of the signal in the time or frequency domain. The memory
            layout of data is 'C'. E.g. data of ``shape = (3, 2, 1024)`` has
            3 x 2 channels with 1024 samples or frequency bins each. Time data
            is converted to ``float``. Frequency is converted to ``complex``
            and must be provided as single sided spectra, i.e., for all
            frequencies between 0 Hz and half the sampling rate.
        sampling_rate : double
            Sampling rate in Hz
        sh_kind : str
            Real or complex valued SH bases ``'real'``, ``'complex'``
        n_samples : int, optional
            Number of samples of the time signal. Required if domain is
            ``'freq'``. The default is ``None``, which assumes an even number
            of samples if the data is provided in the frequency domain.
        domain : ``'time'``, ``'freq'``, optional
            Domain of data. The default is ``'time'``
        fft_norm : str, optional
            The normalization of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Can be
            ``'none'``, ``'unitary'``, ``'amplitude'``, ``'rms'``, ``'power'``,
            or ``'psd'``. See :py:func:`~pyfar.dsp.fft.normalization` and [#]_
            for more information. The default is ``'none'``, which is typically
            used for energy signals, such as impulse responses.
        channel_order: str, optional
            The order in which the ambisonics channels are arraged. 
            The default is ``'acn'``
        comment : str
            A comment related to `data`. The default is ``None``.

        To discuss: ambisonics channels always on first dimension?
